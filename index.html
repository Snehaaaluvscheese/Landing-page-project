    <p><em>My husband and I didn't know where to start when we remembered that our precious friend Poppy's birthday was coming up. I came across this website while on a Google excursion and decided to give them a try. Contacting them was the BEST decision of our lives, our girl was SO happy and smiling throughout her special day! My husband and I were truly delighted to see our old girl have fun the whole day and we will most definitely be contacting them again next year after such an awesome... I mean, PAWsome experience.</em></p>
